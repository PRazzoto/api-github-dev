## GitHUB Searcher

This is a project made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that uses the GitHub API to search for a user and display its Repositories. 
The web page that shows all of the repositories can filter by which language it was written, as well as display some 
other pieces of information about the user.
Here is the screenshot of the initial page:

![Tela_Incial_API](https://github.com/PRazzoto/api-github-dev/assets/105748087/bed20602-21df-4470-a98b-bbafbc7d36f4)

After searching for the GitHub username you will be directed to a page that looks like this:

![Tela_2_API](https://github.com/PRazzoto/api-github-dev/assets/105748087/b30ad4c7-32ae-4df4-8a92-4f0600243788)

It is also possible to filter by the language that is used by the repositories, and it would look like something like this:

![Tela_3_API](https://github.com/PRazzoto/api-github-dev/assets/105748087/7179807a-59e4-4cc4-9acd-3359e6c06cf0)


And thatÂ´s how the project works, it was a very nice and fun project to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and also learn the 
basic on how to deal with API's.
